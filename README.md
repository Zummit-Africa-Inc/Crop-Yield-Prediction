# Crop-Yield-Prediction


## Contribution Guidelines
- Have a Look at the [project structure](#project-structure) and [folder overview](#folder-overview) below to understand where to store/upload your contribution
- If you're creating a task, Go to the task folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with task details and goals to help other contributors understand
    - Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
    - Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.
- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.
- Make sure your File names(jupyter notebooks, python files, data sheet file names etc) has proper naming to help others in easily identifing them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnessesary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
